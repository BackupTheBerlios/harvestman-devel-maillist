<PRE>Hi Lucas,

       I figured why this does not work the way we expect.

When we throttle the connections, the connections are put
to sleep by a value which is exactly the lag time for the
throttling to reach its specified value. However, since the
actual speed of the network will be much more than the specified
throttling bandwidth, the connectors will always exceed
it.

For a regular download without any limits, this works because
the controller thread works till the very end and the lag times
typically increase towards the end, thus the final connecitons
get throttled to the maximum when compared to the earlier ones,
providing the required bandwidth once the crawl is complete,
in a normal way.

However, in this case you specify a maxbytes limit also, so
the crawl is killed while in progress, while the throttling has not
fully adjusted to the given bandwidth requirement, the controller
is not allowed to go the logical end of the crawl.

This could be considered as a flaw in our throttling logic, in that
it will work only if the controller thread is allowed to logically
finish and won't work if it has to exit in between due to max bytes,
max files or max time limits.

To make this work even with these limits, we have to throttle
more agressively if limits are enabled right from the beginning.
This can be done by increasing the factor of the throttling.
Currently I am using a factor of 1.01 (1% extra), but for limits
this has to be much higher to get the required effect. Perhaps
we could use a higher factor anyway, say something in the
range of 1.2-1.5. Since the throttling logic checks if we are
behind or ahead and adjusts accordingly, it should work fine
even for a regular crawl without limits.

Try adjusting the factor (in datamgr.py-&gt;class HarvestManController
-&gt;_manage_bandwidth function) from the current 1.01 to
some experimental values and see if an increase in the
factor gives you the required effect.  If it does, try for a regular
crawl and see if this increase throttles it to a too low bandwidth.
I guess it won't.

The other option is to expose the throttling sleep factor as
an option in the config file so that the user can specify it.
However it will be at most a &quot;hunch factor&quot; and the user
will have to get it right by trial and error.

Hope this is clear. Let me know if you have any more questions
on this.

regards

--Anand

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>        I have fixed both issues #1 and #11. #1 is fixed by moving the

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This works fine in my tests. It was even able to limit the speed
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to 2.08 kbps when 2.00 was requested! It is slightly on the conservative
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> side, so that even if we under achieve the speeds, we never overshoot
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> them.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Please test now and close the bug as verified. I have marked it as fixed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'll test it tonight.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've tested it and for some reason I still get the speed of 8kb when I
</I>&gt;<i> crawl automotive.com at 5kb and max download of 5mb.
