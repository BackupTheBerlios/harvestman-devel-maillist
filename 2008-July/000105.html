<PRE>Hi,

 I have updated issue #7 with the new filter design. Please see
<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/harvestman-crawler/issues/detail?id=7">http://code.google.com/p/harvestman-crawler/issues/detail?id=7</A> for changes.

I am including the new filter design in this email also.

------------
The filters will be changed to the following single filtering mechanism.
There will be a single &lt;filter&gt; element which will enclose specific filters.

There will be two distinct type of filters, namely &quot;urlfilter&quot;
and &quot;textfilter&quot;. The former filter will work on URLs and latter
on text content of pages.

The &quot;urlfilter&quot; can consist of three types of filters.

I. URL filters

1. A regular expression filter which allows one to specify a regular
expression to filter out URLs. These work just like regular expressions.
2. A URL &quot;path&quot; filter which allows to specify parts of a URL as a filter.
This works as follows.

A path is any part of a URL. It could be a part or a complete URL
or its beginning or front. It allows wildcards by using &quot;*&quot;.

Example: -/images/private/
     - Exclude any URL matching /images/private anywhere in the URL

         -/images/*+/images/public/*

    - Exclude any URL with /images/, but
      allow any URL which has /images/public in it. This would block the
      following URLs.

      <A HREF="http://www.foo.com/images/image1.jpg">http://www.foo.com/images/image1.jpg</A>
      <A HREF="http://www.foo.com/images/image2.jpg">http://www.foo.com/images/image2.jpg</A>
      <A HREF="http://www.foo.com/images/image3.jpg">http://www.foo.com/images/image3.jpg</A>

      But it will allow the following URLs,

      <A HREF="http://www.foo.com/images/public/pub1.jpg">http://www.foo.com/images/public/pub1.jpg</A>
      <A HREF="http://www.foo.com/images/public/pub2.jpg">http://www.foo.com/images/public/pub2.jpg</A>


3. A file extension filter which allows to specify file extensions of URLs
as the basis to be filtered.

This filter is quite simple, allowing to specify file extensions to
be filtered.

Example:

   &quot;-jpg,-png&quot; or
   &quot;-jpg -png&quot;

Means - filter out URLs with extensions .jpg and .png. This will filter
out most JPEG and PNG images. The &quot;.&quot; are not required in the filter
but a comma or space is required between the subsequent extensions.

These filters are titled &quot;regexp&quot; &quot;path&quot; and &quot;extension&quot; respectively.

All filters will follow the existing syntax of exclude using &quot;-&quot; prefix
and include using &quot;+&quot; prefix. Further, filters can be tied together in the same
string by using + and - chars.

If a - or + prefix is not found, it is assumed that the filter specifies
an exclusion, i.e URLs matching the filter are filtered out. However
regex filters will *not* support the + or - prefix since it would be
difficult to parse such filters as + or - can be part of the regular
expression itself. Regex filters hence are always considered to be exclusion
filters (If you want a regex filter to be inclusion, reverse the regex...)

All filter values will be specified as the &quot;value&quot; attribute of the
elements. Also filters will act cumulatively. A URL is checked to match
any of the filters and action taken accordingly. There is no way
to specify a relation between filters, i.e something like (filterA and filterB)
or filterC. It is always an OR relation, i.e

if match(filterA) or filterB or filterC:
    # Take action
    ...

However you can disable a filter by settings its &quot;enable&quot; attribute to zero.

Here are samples of filters.

&lt;urlfilter&gt;
  &lt;regexp value=&quot;(\s*\/banner\/)&quot; enable=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;path value=&quot;-/images/*+/images/public/*&quot; enable=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;extension value=&quot;-jpg,-png&quot; enable=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/urlfilter&gt;

The above means that a URL is tried on each of the above as a filter.
If *any* of it match, appropriate  action is taken. Only if none match
is the URL unfiltered.

By default all filters are &quot;crawl&quot; filters. Which means that the URLs are
filtered out before entering them into the crawl URL queue, immediately after
parsing the URLs from a parent URL's web-page. However sometimes one wants
&quot;download&quot; filters, i.e you woud want to fetch and parse these URLs and
find out their child URLs, but only apply the filter as a download filter.

This is possible by specifying the attribute &quot;crawl&quot; in the &lt;urlfilter&gt;
element. By default this is &quot;0&quot;, but if it is set to &quot;1&quot;, URLs are not
checked for filter at the time of crawling, but only at the time of saving
them to disk.

However, this is possible only on the entire set of &lt;urlfilter&gt; types, not
on each individual element.

Example:

&lt;urlfilter crawl=&quot;1&quot; &gt;
  &lt;path value=&quot;-/images/*+/images/public/*&quot; enable=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/urlfilter&gt;

The above filter means that any checking is done only at the file-saving
time and not during crawling. N

NOTE: Note that crawl attribute makes sense only for web-page
(HTML) filters and hence don't use it if your filters
only match non-webpage URLs like images, documents (PDF) etc.
For non-webpage URLs, filters work only as download filters
anyway.

NOTE: By default regex filters are UNICODE filters. Regex filters
take additional argument called &quot;flags&quot; which allows one to pass
additional flags taken by Python's re module to them. For example,
to specify a filter to match the current locale,

  &lt;regexp value=&quot;(\s*\/banner\/)&quot; enable=&quot;1&quot; flags=&quot;re.LOCALE&quot; /&gt;

Also, all filters are case-insensitive by default.  To enable
case-sensitivity all filters take a &quot;case&quot; attribute which is &quot;0&quot;
by default. To enable casing, set it to 1.

Example:

&lt;urlfilter&gt;
  &lt;regexp value=&quot;(\s*\/banner\/)&quot; enable=&quot;1&quot; case=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;path value=&quot;-/images/*+/images/public/*&quot; enable=&quot;1&quot; case=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;extension value=&quot;-jpg,-png&quot; enable=&quot;1&quot; case=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/urlfilter&gt;

NOTE: There is no top-level &quot;case&quot; attribute. So casing has to
be set individually for each filter if required.

2. Text Filters

Text-filters work on the URL content, title, keywords and description.
These filters accept only regular expressions and is always an
exclude filter, i.e there is no way to specify an inclusion or exclusion
in the filter text by using a + or -. Any such logic has to be part
of the regular expression itself.

Text-filters are of two types.

1. Content-filter - This works only on the body of the web-page, excluding
the HTML tags. It is a regular expression filter. The element name is
&quot;content&quot;.

Example:

   &lt;content value=&quot;(Python\s+Perl)&quot; flags=&quot;re.MULTILINE&quot; /&gt;

2. metafilter - This works on the content of the tags &quot;title&quot;, &quot;keywords&quot; and
&quot;description&quot; (as of now, more tags could be added later). It takes a &quot;tags&quot;
attribute which by default is set to &quot;all&quot; which means that the filter will
be applied to any of these tags, looking for a match. To specify specific tags
change the value of this attribute. It accepts 'OR'ing and 'AND'ing of tags
by using &quot;|&quot; and &quot;&amp;&quot; respectively. The element name is &quot;meta&quot;.

Examples:

  &lt;meta value=&quot;web-bot&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;meta value=&quot;(web-bot|crawler|robot|web-crawler)&quot;
tags=&quot;keywords|description&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;meta value=&quot;(web-bot|crawler|robot|web-crawler)&quot;
tags=&quot;keywords&amp;description&quot;/&gt;

The 2nd filer will apply if the regex matches content of either the
&quot;keywords&quot; or
&quot;description&quot; tags, but the last will apply only if it matches both of them.

NOTE: For &quot;keywords&quot; the regexp is applied to every item in the keyword list
separately, not to the entire string. For example if the &quot;keywords&quot; is,

&lt;meta name=&quot;keywords&quot; content=&quot;crawler, spider, bot, web-bot, robot&quot; /&gt;

Then the keywords regexp is applied to each item of the list
[&quot;crawler&quot;,&quot;spider&quot;,&quot;bot&quot;,&quot;web-bot&quot;,&quot;robot&quot;] separately. If any match the filter
is assumed to have matched &quot;keywords&quot; tag.

NOTE: If you want separate regexp for these tags, do as follows.

 &lt;meta value=&quot;(web-bot|crawler|robot|web-crawler)&quot; tags=&quot;keywords&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;meta value=&quot;internet|crawler|web-bot|web-crawler&quot; tags=&quot;description&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;meta value=&quot;harvestman|web-crawler&quot; tags=&quot;title&quot;/&gt;

Here is a complete example of a text-filter.

&lt;textfilter&gt;
 &lt;content value=&quot;(Python\s+Perl)&quot; flags=&quot;re.MULTILINE&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;meta value=&quot;(web-bot|crawler|robot|web-crawler)&quot; tags=&quot;keywords&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;meta value=&quot;internet|crawler|web-bot|web-crawler&quot; tags=&quot;description&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;meta value=&quot;harvestman|web-crawler&quot; tags=&quot;title&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/textfilter&gt;

NOTE: Text-filters also accept the &quot;case&quot; attribute per filter.

That is all.

Please give feedbacks!
