As the UI part. It would be nice to move the genconfig.py (config file
generation) to one of the tabs in ui. One of the tabs in harvestman
--ui  would be &quot;config.xml&quot; which would allow for just one place to
go.


 It would be great if someone could look at RSS
&gt;<i> integration (#10) and
</I>
scheduling (#9).
I don't know if we want to build a scheduler? I was thinking that
after I get my config files I would setup a cronjob (on
linux)/scheduled task(windows) to start the harvestman, with my
config.xml as a paramter, and let it do its job. For me that would
seem more natural as I will let my operating system to run everything.
Comments?

</I>&gt;<i> Last was in Sep 2005 and the program has come a long
</I>&gt;<i> way since then, but with no public releases. It is very important
</I>&gt;<i> to do this version and release it at the earliest with ample
</I>&gt;<i> documentation.

Could you update the wiki with this information.
