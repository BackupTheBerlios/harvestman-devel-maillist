(let me know when you get the svn dump moved over.)

1. Wrong install folder?
I was using virtualenv to install harvestmen... but it seems as it
installed itself in python default location.
my virtual env path was /usr/local/pythonpath/baseline/...

Not sure if you use "http://pythonpaste.org/script/" or your custom
setup.py etc... http://lucasmanual.com/mywiki/Paste

error....
python setup.py install
........
Creating basic configuration in /etc/harvestman...

The genconfig looks good. Its even easier to set it up then editing
files. It seems to me that xml config style is more similar to lucene
xml style. It would be easier to create ini file from scratch, but as
long as there are some tools for making the xml, I think it will be
ok.


2. I would provide 3 sample config files in "exemples" folder.  a.
(shortest config.xml), b. standard_config.xml (which is recommended
way you should crawl pages) and advanced_config.xml that has all the
options.


3 . In genconf.py . I  would put a little note under "verbosity 1 is
abc, 2 is bcd, 3 is dfs...." and the same thing under fetch level,
since I don't know of hand what options they represent. Everything
else seems straight forward.

4.  I would add a command "harvestman genconf" or "harvestman
--genconf" to list of available options, so I can call the program
from a command line.

5. I got my config file but:
 harvestman -c config2.xml Loading system configuration...
Error assigning option " cache_status "
Error traceback...
  File "/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/harvestman/lib/config.py",
line 691, in set_option_xml
    self.assign_option(option_val, value)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/harvestman/lib/config.py",
line 564, in assign_option
    fval = (eval(typ))(value)

I'm attaching the config file.


If you could give me access to wiki, I could put some examples out
there some time this week.

Thanks,
Lucas

Sounds good. Not sure what you should put there yet? I guess I might
have more ideas when I start using harvestman.

Thanks,
