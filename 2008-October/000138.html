<PRE>Hi,

   I have modified all the paths in modules which do cross
folder imports in code to import relative to top-level
&quot;harvestman&quot; folder.

 For example, earlier harvestman/apps/appbase.py contained
this line.

&quot;from lib import config&quot;

This is now changed to

&quot;from harvestman.lib import config&quot;

The reason is simple - relative path import which was there before
is bad. It is better to import everything from the top-level when
we are importing across folders at the same level.

However, for same/sub-folders, there is no need for changing. So
under lib/, evey import remains the same, since the modules
are either importing from the current folder or the sub-folder
&quot;common&quot;.

Because this scheme causes problems with the apps/harvestman.py
module, I renamed apps/harvestman.py to apps/spider.py . Because
of this change, we no longer need apps/harvestmanimp.py, so this
is removed.

So, if you are having code which imports HarvestMan class as following,

&quot;from harvestman.apps.harvestmanimp import HarvestMan&quot;,

please change it to,

&quot;from harvestman.apps.spider import HarvestMan&quot;

(Tom, you will need to do this for your sample crawler code from
here on.)

I was having major problems trying to create a Windows executable
(with py2exe) using the current relative path import scheme. I had
a feeling it was broken earlier, but did not realize how bad till I
tried to get the executable working. It just will not work with the
relative path imports across folders. With this scheme, things work
fine and I guess this is the best solution going forward.

Also there was this confusion between harvestman folder and
harvestman.py module. Renaming it to spider.py fixes that problem.
I did not want do do away with harvestman.py, but looks like
it will cause many problems, if it remains there.

If there is some documentation in the wiki which references these paths,
please update them, both at the google site and at
harvestman.everythingability.com.

Lukasz, I think these changes will break your branch for virtualenv,
so we need to merge the changes and test how it works. I have a feeling
that your virtualenv will work much better with this change.

Please note that I have checekd in changes to trunk but 2.0-dev
branch retains the old style. It may not matter as changes are
still happening in trunk with nothing much going on in 2.0-dev :)
Anyway, I will just create this branch fresh from trunk since it
has not seen much changes after branching off...

Thanks!
