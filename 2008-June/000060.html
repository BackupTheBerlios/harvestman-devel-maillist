<PRE>Hi,

On Tue, Jun 24, 2008 at 10:41 PM, Lukasz Szybalski &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/harvestman-devel">szybalski at gmail.com</A>&gt; wrote:

</I>&gt;<i> That is the whole process for converting xml style to python style. Makes sense.
</I>&gt;<i> What do you use the: CONFIG_XML_TEMPLATE for?
</I>
This is used to create the basic config file entries in the system
(/etc/harvestman)
and for the user ~/.harvestman/conf/config.xml . The former happens when
the program is installed (using setup.py) and latter when the user
runs the program
for the first time.

Every time the system and user conf files are loaded in that order. This allows
to customize the program at a global level (for all users) and specifically for
the user. So effectively there are many levels of config file customization...

1. system
2. User
3. Project(s)

At every level settings, override that of the previous level.


&gt;<i> ok. I wonder if we should include tb? I've added it to my code.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm just thinking who will download 1tb+ of data in single download. I
</I>&gt;<i> think undo my changes.
</I>
Yes. I dont think anyone uses this program or will use it to download
terabytes of data :)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wasn't sure if the _bytes is something that might be used by a
</I>&gt;<i> thread or in a global setting?
</I>&gt;<i> When do you call clean up code ?
</I>
It is a global setting which is updated by every thread. Since it is an
integer, no locking is necessary. Clean up is done, right at the
end in the &quot;finalize()&quot; method of &quot;HarvestMan&quot; class.


&gt;&gt;<i> So even if you specify your limit as X bytes, the actual bytes saved would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be X+dx, where dx is mostly a random factor, depending on the number of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> max connections, thread state etc. This is not a problem with large limits,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> since it will be exceeded only by a few KBs, but for a smaller limit,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the difference
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can be significant.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In the config-sample.xml I indicate a max limit of 50 K, but the actual
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> download comes to 123k due to this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think this is only because the small size. If average page is 100kb,
</I>&gt;<i> then 100kb * # of threads will be our +- constant.  That sounds good
</I>&gt;<i> to me.  I think it would matter if mb or gb are way off.
</I>
I added a fix for this, by using a &quot;blockwrite&quot; flag in connector objects.
In the &quot;endloop&quot; method of the queue class (in urlqueue.py) which
is called by the controller thread to end crawling, I get all active
connectors and sets this flag. The connectors check this flag before
writing the data to disk.

Also, I modified the exit logic so that for controller triggered exits
(file, bytes or time limits), we don't wait for the threads to complete
their action.

Again, I modified limit checking on bytes to trigger exit at 90% of
the max limit.

Further we had a bug in the code. We were printing the actual
bytes downloaded at the end which need not equal the actual saved
bytes (to disk) for a controller-triggered exit on maxbytes. Hence I
added a 'savedbytes' counter to the data manager class and a
function to update it. This is updated by the connector objects only
after a successful write to disk. We also check this counter in the
controller thread, not &quot;bytes&quot;. Finally, this is printed on the console
separately.

All these 4 changes makes sure we exit with saved bytes very
close to the required limit.

My tests show saved bytes average of 54 kb for a 50 kb limit,
102 kb for a 100 kb limit etc, after this change, which is pretty
good and much better than before.

&gt;<i> I think if the thread finishes downloading and stops that will be
</I>&gt;<i> fine. If we tell it to don't save the data, then we have to make sure
</I>&gt;<i> we do it in index, history, etc....I think that would be to much.
</I>&gt;<i> Unless there would be another reason for it, which I don't see
</I>&gt;<i> currently.
</I>
This is not required, because we are setting the flag (state) on
the connectors, and not messing up the threads.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The code will have to be changed in connector.py, datamgr.py and perhaps
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in crawler.py, urlthread.py and urlqueue.py, otherwise I will implement this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and close the bug.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anyway, I have checked in these changes I made, so you can test it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at your end.
</I>
You can close the bug now after testing it by running the crawler on
config-sample.xml .
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> Lucas
