Subject: [HarvestMan-devel] crawl results after a form submit?
Message-ID: <804e5c70901201057p2400613dwcc36c729e2f0b58c@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Somebody mentioned that they wanted to crawl this website which has a
form associated to it. I would like to submit the form with a value
and crawl the results.

How can this be done?
http://bioguide.congress.gov/biosearch/biosearch.asp
I want to submit this form with this field:

<form method="POST"
action="http://bioguide.congress.gov/biosearch/biosearch1.asp">

INPUT SIZE=4 NAME="congress" VALUE=""

This field is a year: 2009

Can I do it from a configuration xml file?

Thanks,
Lucas
