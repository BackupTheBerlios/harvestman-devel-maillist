Hi,

   First of all, thanks for joining the HarvestMan-devel mailing list!
 I am hoping that the members of this list can come together to write
some quality software together and try and have fun at the same
time...:)

The main purpose of this list is to get together developers who are
interested in writing code for the HarvestMan project. The specific
immediate purpose is to develop a design and do a prototype
implementation of a distributed HarvestMan using p2p architecture by
reusing existing HarvestMan code.

First of all, you need to be familiar with the HarvestMan project. The
project website is at http://harvestmanontheweb.com. You can find some
documentation there - the FAQ is useful but some parts of it is out of
date. Most of the documentation is also pretty out of date w.r.t the
current code.

The project is hosted at Berlios as "harvestman". The project URL is
http://developer.berlios.de/projects/harvestman. The current development version
is 2.0.

You need to create a developer id at berlios so I can add you to the
project as a developer (Ignore if you are already in). Once that is
done, you can check out  the code as developer. For that do the
following.

$export CVSROOT=<username>@cvs.harvestman.berlios.de:/cvsroot/harvestman
$export CVS_RSH=ssh

Then checkout the latest source code using

$ cvs co HarvestMan-2.0

You need to teach yourself how to use the program. The easiest way is to run it
out of the box (no installation required though a setup.py is
provided). Developers should *not* do a setup.py installation since
this will copy the modules to your Python installation folder and any
local changes you make may not be visible later.

$ python harvestman.py

This will do a crawl using the default config.xml file and if everything
goes fine, the website referred in that will get saved to your disk.

You can even do a command line crawl in the Python interpreter. This is done
as follows.
$ python
>>> from harvestman import *
>>> prepare()
>>> cfg = GetObject('config')
#    Modify any params for crawl if u feel like
# Here we set download of images to false and no localization
# (localization means converting outward pointing links to disk ones)
>>> cfg.images = 0
>>> cfg.localize = 0
>>> spider = HarvestMan()
>>> spider.main()
...

This uses the default config.xml file to do the crawling (it has to be
present).

The source package also has some documentation I have written for
the upcoming 2.0 release - mostly about how to write plugins. Read that
and play around with the sample plugins - the simulator, userbrowse
and lucene plugin are quite interesting.

Since there is not much documentation on the design etc, I am attaching
two presentations I gave on the project - one which I gave in Norway
for the EIAO project and another one in BangPypers. Some of the information
there is also a bit out of date, however it will give you a good idea on
the design and architecture. Kindly go through them (there are a lot of
common slides which you can skip) and let me know if you have any doubts.

Another project which is related is the d-harvestman project which I
did as a part of a distant course with the Norwegian university. We managed
to develop a prototype of a distributed crawler with a master-slave architecture
in this course. The source code for this is public. It can be seen
at http://sourceforge.net/projects/dcrawler. There are no file releases,
so you can check out the source code using anonymous CVS. It defines
 a distributed crawler on top of old HarvestMan code (Code as of
November 2005). It uses Pyro (http://pyro.sourceforge.net) to
communicate between masters and slaves.

The project report and design document for this project can
be downloaded from http://steinbit.agder-ikt.hia.no/~aandas99/ .

The design planned for the new distributed harvestman is not  a master-slave
one but a p2p one. So not much code can be reused from this project, still
it is good for reference.

Please reply back with any questions, to the list. Thanks for
your participation.
