option.
Using "Harvestman-2.0.4beta" with Python 2.4:

Loading system configuration... 
Loading user configuration... 
Using configuration file config.xml... 
Loading plugin simulator... 
Applying plugin simulator... 
Error while trying to apply plugin simulator 
Error is: Error: connector has no plugins defined!


Any hints to resolve this?

Thank you in advance
