Subject: [HarvestMan-devel] Storing page text in mysql
Message-ID: <4A284F19.9040701@campusactivism.org>

I want to store page text in MySQL (along with the url).  I'm wondering 
if anyone has already done this or would have suggestions as to how I 
should do it?

I'm completely new to python, but have been doing php for a long time.

Ultimately I want to grab non-html text for each page. Tokenize into 
words.  Then count how many times each word appers on each page.  But 
for starters, I need the non-html text.

(I apologize if this is the wrong place to post this, I didn't see a 
users/support forum).

Aaron

Aaron, its not clear if you want to do this within the context of
HarvestMan, or in some other context? HM is a web
crawler,<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler>providing a
framework to crawl web sites, and ultimately provides you the
html from the crawled web pages.

To parse html, you can use Beautiful Soup or lxml. To access MySQL, you can
use MySQLdb (be sure to use the pythonic form of the api as specified in the
PEP <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/>, not the raw "c" style
functions).

If you need to know how to integrate these into the HM framework - I'm sure
one of the devs will jump in.

HTH,
Vijay

Hi,

I'm interested in status of HarvestMan-Lite?
Will it be over soon?


Also, is there a way of making donations?


Have fun,
