</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         I integrated your paste branch's code to the trunk. Happy

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> crawl in the virtualenv!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        The problem was that your library code was out of date

</I>&gt;<i> You usually don't copy files over.. you can use svn merge which will

</I>&gt;<i> revision history as well. I didn't use it yet but I'm learning, so I
</I>&gt;<i> think if you use svn merge all the comments and checkins are copied

Well, I am not very sure we want to do this for merging such small
changes over. It is more useful when copying files from a tree
which had a long development history, like we tried to do for the
HarvestMan code earlier when I had imported it into google code.

For the time being, I am just adding stuff to trunk instead of merging.
I am not very good with the merges anyway !

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       I tested that even the --ui option works.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks for the good work.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Btw, the setup.py for virtual env differs a lot from the system setup.py.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For example in virtualenv setup.py we cannot create a system-wide
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> configuration file (/etc/harvestman/config.xml), since there won't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be the requisite permissions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It should. The code that you looked at with sys.prefix checks if the
</I>&gt;<i> folder is in virtualenv style (/home/lucas/) if the sys.prefix is '/'
</I>&gt;<i> that means you are installing as root on system wide setup and it
</I>&gt;<i> should install it in /etc/harvestman/config.xml.
</I>
I figured why this did not happen for me. You had modified
&quot;set_sys_params&quot; in config.py to adjust self.etcdir in your branch.
Once I added this it works.

However, your way of doing it is not generic, in that if you try to
use this code outside virtualenv, in regular setup, it still creates
a local &quot;etc&quot; folder instead of installing to system /etc. I have
changed the logic to use sys.prefix instead of figuring out the
path from __main__. Please use the same logic for it to work
in both virtualenv and regular shell install.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You are able to install it there only as root(/etc/ is owned by root).
</I>&gt;<i> If you don't have root permissions you have to either use virtualenv
</I>&gt;<i> or prefix to point to some folder in your home dir.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, for the time being I have retained
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the virtualenv setup.py as setup_paste.py in the trunk without
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> overwriting the original setup.py.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to use the new setup.py because we can do few things with it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. python setup.py bdist_egg
</I>&gt;<i>  This will build the egg for the harvestman which you can distribute
</I>&gt;<i> and install with easy_install
</I>&gt;<i> easy_install -i someegg.egg
</I>&gt;<i> 2. We can register the package in pypi. python setup.py register
</I>&gt;<i> 3. When it is in PYPI you can go to any computer that has setuptools
</I>&gt;<i> and install havervestman like this:
</I>&gt;<i> easy_install harvestman which will get all you need from
</I>&gt;<i> python.org/PyPI . Or easy_install harvestman=2.0 or easy_install
</I>&gt;<i> harvestman=dev which will install from our trunk. (you don't have to
</I>&gt;<i> download anything)
</I>&gt;<i> 4. The new setup.py has test code taken out because if you create a
</I>&gt;<i> new crawling project you can add harvestman as requirement in setup.py
</I>&gt;<i> that says 'require harvestman'. So when I install my project I need
</I>&gt;<i> harvestman to just install and if you want to test it you can do
</I>&gt;<i> harvestman --selftest. So I took out the self testing code in there.
</I>
This is fine, but make sure that you are not doing any regressions
when you replace the setup.py with yours. For the time being, please
retain the old setup.py as setup.py.orig in the trunk when you merge
the code to the trunk.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Btw, I did not understand README.paste. It does not seem like a README
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to me, instead consists of the tree of HarvestMan folder. Can you add
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a proper README to trunk which explains the virtualenv setup ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll modify it, and add proper comments.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, I dont understand the connection between virtualenv and Python paste
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> frankly :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What paste did was to create skeloton of the python package.  I did
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;paster create myapp&quot; which creates default setup.py ...and all
</I>&gt;<i> folders that are required to create an egg package. From there you can
</I>&gt;<i> do what you did before or you can use pastescript to give you more
</I>&gt;<i> control on what is installing where or if you need to do some parsing
</I>&gt;<i> of command lines. It can for example parse  harvestman --goodbye , not
</I>&gt;<i> sure if you wrote the code to do that or not. Another advantage is
</I>&gt;<i> that it allows you to use &quot;from harvestman import xyz&quot; vs before you
</I>&gt;<i> were using &quot;import xyz&quot;, this allows you control the imports better.
</I>&gt;<i> If somebody else writes a different project they can use the same
</I>&gt;<i> imports &quot;from harvestman.lib import common&quot; etc...  You don't have to
</I>&gt;<i> manipulate the global variables to get you from one folder to another
</I>&gt;<i> as it will figure out what is where.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://lucasmanual.com/mywiki/PythonPaste">http://lucasmanual.com/mywiki/PythonPaste</A>
</I>&gt;<i> So paste only provided skeleton, and we currently don't use it for
</I>&gt;<i> anything else. I would like to convert the part that pareses your
</I>&gt;<i> command line input to use paste but maybe later.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have checked in all code to trunk. Please test that this works in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the trunk at your end
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and then remove the paste branch.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll check if all the files got moved over correctly. I'll keep in for
</I>&gt;<i> now and when we merged everything I'll delete it.
</I>
I had missed setup.cfg. I added it now.

Thanks,
