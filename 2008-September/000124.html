I don't know if doing that will help. After reading a little I think
we should do it the other way around. I think if you are working with
features that you need to implement you should continue doing that in
trunk. All dev stuff should go into trunk, and when we are ready for
release then you setup a branch 2.0alpha and you do bug fixes there.
(unless this new feature is really big more then 3weeks+)

I have read about creating a branch and setting up the start branch
points thanks to which I can later just issue a command &quot; svn merge
this to that&quot; and I'm done.

So to keep things simple I would prefer if we work in trunk on any dev
stuff. (Unless you have a reason not to do that?)

If you get a trunk working (since you said it was broken 3-4 weeks
back) just send me an email, and I can merge the trunk into my branch
to update the code a little and continue working until I fix it all.

Let me know.
Lucas
