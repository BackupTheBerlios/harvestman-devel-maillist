Is there a reason you went with xml config file?
It is really hard to edit xml. I would much prefer python style
configuration.  My first experience was an invalid xml config file
that was one the website as an example.  So I had to use command line
options. But I guess that is something for the future.

What kind of gui skeleton you are talking about? web based? I could
easly create something in turbogears.

I could help but right now am still trying to get it working. As soon
as download throttling is available I should be using it more, and
hopefully help out.
