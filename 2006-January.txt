Subject: [HarvestMan-devel] harvestman checkin (not distributed ver)
Message-ID: <20060110090608.OZP20050.fed1rmmtao06.cox.net@zt3000>

Hi all,

 

Checked in the following stuff to HarvestMan:

 

config.py

config.xml

pageparser.py

urlparser.py

xmlparser.py

 

Of course it wouldn't be a first checkin if I didn't mess something up.  I
checked in config.xml twice because the first checkin had my local copy, not
the copy I really wanted in the repository.  Anyways, it's fixed now :-P

 

I ran it through a couple of page crawls and everything looked good.  No
intense intense testing though .... 

 

Here's some details on what I changed.

 

1) in xmlparser.py.  Before if we had a config file entry like this in
config.xml there is a problem:

<url>http://asdf.com/cgi-bin/dbman.cgi?db=store&amp;uid=default</url>

 

That used to break xml parsing because expat xml parser will call char_data
3 times -- just for this one http string.  It would call it with
"http://asdf.com/cgi-bin/dbman.cgi?db=store"

Then with "&"

Then finally with "uid=default"

With the old code, the whole string will not be put into the Url config --
only the first string "http://asdf.com/cgi-bin/dbman.cgi?db=store".

 

What I have done is add an "end_element" callback as well and tweaked the
char_data callback.  Now we will wait until the "end_element" callback is
triggered before we actually place the XML config file data into our
internal configuration structure.  This insures that we get all the data
inbetween XML config file elements, regardless of how many times the expat
parser call "char_data" inbetween elements.

 

2) In general, second two changes are in regard to how we handle forms
downloading.

2.a)  I changed the name of skipqueryforms to getqueryforms.  Before
skipqueryforms was mapped to "forms" in the "download" "types" segment of
config.xml.  However, the meaning was reversed before.  If you put <forms
value="1"/> in the config before, it would NOT download forms.  This goes
against the current paradigm, because if you put the same for html, or
images, or javascript in the config, you WILL download the forms.

 

In other words ... before if this (below) was the config file, we would have
downloaded all html, images, js AND forms -- even though forms is set to
zero.

 

    <download>

      <types>

        <html value="1"/>

        <images value="1"/>

        <javascript value="1"/>

        <javaapplet value="1"/>

        <forms value="0"/>

        <cookies value="1"/>

      </types>

    </download>

 

Now forms behaves as the others.  If set to 1, we get forms.  If set to 0,
we don't get forms.  I changed the default in config.xml as well to reflect
this so functionality stays the same as before.  Anand you can turn this off
if you want in config.xml ... dunno if we want that on by default.

 

2.b) Before, even if we told HarvestMan to download forms, it still
considers most form URL's to not be HTML.  I needed to add another if
statement at the end of is_webpage() (that will only be checked when forms
download is set to true) that will consider a typical "forms" style URL to
be a webpage.  

 

In other words, I changed is_webpage() to return true for URLs that appear
to be forms.  Otherwise, there is no link scanning in forms generated HTML.
Again, this check will only happen if forms downloading is set to True in
config.xml (which again is defaulted on).

 

Thanks

John
