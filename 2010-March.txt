Hello ,

I'm a learner of python ,and I have learned the 1.46 version of the
harveatman 

Now I find the 2.0 alpha version ,and I want to researched it,but I find I
can not build the project 

In windows platform ,the execute file I build can't run correctly 

So I just want to know  how to build the project into the execute file like
the win32 zip package "HarvestMan-2.0alpha07102008_win32.zip" 

 

 Thanks very much !!!
