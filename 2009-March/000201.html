<PRE>I am using wxPython on Windows to develop a GUI front end to this
powerful web crawler.  I intend to make it publicly available under GPL.
I have studied all HarvestMan documentation I could find, as well as the
source code, including doc strings.  I have several questions which I
hope can be answered through this list.

The GUI dialog I developed offers a subset of criteria for determining
what files are downloaded.  When a button is pressed, the spider
application is initiated in a manner similar to the samples provided
with HarvestMan.    I want to make the program a Windows/rather than
console mode one where status messages are redirected to a multiline
edit box rather than printed to the console.  I have not figured out a
way to do this until the crawling/fetching process is over.  When the
spider runs on the main thread, it blocks other wx events that update
the GUI.  This happens even with the wx.CallAfter technique for changing
a GUI from other than the main thread.  Once the spider has completed a
project, all the status messages appear at once in the edit box (so I
know the issue is mainly a matter of threading and timing).

I posted a message about this problem on the wxPython list.  A
suggestion was to launch the spider in a separate thread.  I tried this,
but got a HarvestMan fatal error about a signal having to be called from
the main thread.

Besides the problem of redirecting status messages to the GUI in real
time, I have not figured out how to terminate the spider other than by
pressing Control+C.  This is not a friendly technique on Windows because
users are accustomed to Control+C being the key to copy text to the
clipboard, and GUI users are more accustomed to something that can be
done with a mouse.  Thus, I would like to have a button in the GUI
dialog that can cancel the spider without exiting the whole program.  Is
there a particular method I can call for doing this cleanly?

Other questions are related to the conceptual organization of the
spider.  I know there are crawler, fetcher, and tracker threads, but do
not truly understand their interaction.  Can someone give more detail
about what each type of thread does, what queues are involved, and how
the threads communicate?  I am relatively new to threading but trying
hard to understand the key aspects needed for this application.

I am also interested in an explanation of the fields in the SqLite
tables that HarvestMan maintains, in case my program can make use of
that data in other ways.

Naturally, I may have more questions later, but answers to these will
help a lot!

Regards,
Jamal
