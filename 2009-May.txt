Hi Lukasz,

  I have created a new entry in trunk named "HarvestMan-lite".
The idea is to trim unncessary and old code from HarvestMan
code base to create a lightweight ( in terms  of amount of code
and also performance) program.

 I have done the first level of work today, removing a number
of irrelevant modules and files from the codebase. Also a number
of modules were trimmed.

Going ahead, the plan would be to refactor the code and remove
un-necessary logic (like the "objects" namespace holding each object
, instead make everything with single instance a singleton) and
to take a re-look at the code and remove/collate functions etc.

The final phase would be a performance improvement, identifying
bottle necks and removing/updating data structures to improve
the memory usage of the program.

Once this is done the current HarvestMan source trunk would be
archived and HarvestMan-lite would replace it. I would also
move the "Hget" downloader to a separate project.

The idea is to then use this trimmed codebase to work on
the scalable "super HarvestMan" which would use multiple processes
(each being a "HarvestMan" application) to scale up crawling.

The complete refactoring I guess would take around 1 month
plus.

Kindly let me know your thoughts.

That would be great, as the code base would become easier to understand
and incorporate into other Python apps.
