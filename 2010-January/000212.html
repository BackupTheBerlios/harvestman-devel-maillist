<PRE>Hi Feisal,

</I>Yeah. I wrote html_table_crawler.py generally to demo
specific tag processing and specifically as an example to solve
your problem...

Well, I analyzed your table structure and found that there are
4 columns in total, the first two containing CDATA and the next two
containing &lt;a href=&quot;...&quot;&gt; i.e link data. Since you need all the
data, over-riding only the &quot;before_tag_data&quot; event is not enough,
you also need to override the &quot;before_tag_parse&quot; event.

&quot;before_tag_parse&quot; event is raised before parsing an HTML
tag, i.e in effect it is raised for every HTML tag. Since &quot;before_tag_data&quot;
event is raised for the CDATA, this
is always raised after &quot;before_tag_parse&quot;, since CDATA
is processed once the tag is opened.

Using this and by maintaining some state in the crawler across the
two calls, it is possible to extract the data exactly the way you
want. In this case, I did it by adding two additional state
variables, one a list for storing the CDATA of the two &lt;td&gt;
tags, and another a counter for resetting this list  after
end of parsing the 2 link (&lt;a...&gt;) tags.

I have checked in the code to the same place. The event
API is slightly modified too, by replacing the keyword
argument with positional ones, that makes it easy to see
what is happening. Also I added an alias for &quot;bind_event&quot;
as &quot;register&quot;, which feels more easy to understand :)

Now you can use &quot;html_table_crawler.py&quot; with minor modifications
to process the required data.

The event API is new and I haven't yet written much
documentation on it, so I understand it might feel a bit difficult.
In fact, you will be one of the very first people to use it,
so feel free to ask any questions that may arise. I will
be adding a couple of wiki pages in the coming days
to explain this API on the google project page.


Again thank you very much for your explation.

</I>You are welcome. Please sync your code with subversion
 to get the changes.
